Food production greenhouse emissions is one of the most important causes of climate change. In order to make the best choices, concious consumers need a tool to get information on food environment impact, 
nutritional data and health concerns. With our solution, we are developing an app that gives consumers the relevant information that they are looking for in an easy to use manner
. We collect data from public databases and user contributions, then we make classifications based on general to more specific foods. This way we give general estimations 
of product environment impact such as CO2 emission, water usage, energy usage and land usage in the making of a product. The goal is that the users can easily compare
environment impact vs nutritional value in foods, so they themselves can make better choices for the planet.

# The solution
## 1. Users can either search a product or scan its barcode

## 3. Share food nutritional and environment data with others. Make it a social experience!

# What we are working on

## 1. Daily lists or diets
Users can log their foods, know their macros, vitamins and minerals consumption while also knowing the environment impact of their diet

## 2. Generating relevant knowledge through IBM's Watson Knowledge Studio
Currently we have a very small number of products (~1000) registered, and an even smaller number 
of users. However, using this small dataset we are already trying to get some valuable insights

## 3. Use IBM Food Trust in order to get valuable knowledge on supply chains and distribution
